# TypeSafe design patterns

Start from the behavior the user wants: what will the application show, select,
change, or hand off? Work backward to the judgments it needs. Keep known rules,
calculations, exact lookups, and execution in code. Preserve the user's chosen stack
and scope; add TypeSafe where semantic understanding helps.

When brainstorming or choosing an architecture, consider more than classification.
The patterns below are starting points: combine primitives around the user's goal,
including ideas that do not fit an established recipe.

- **Route and fill known arguments.** A request can select a handler and its typed
  parameters. Ask useful branch-specific questions up front and consume only the
  relevant answers. Explore [function calling](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/function_calling.md)
  and [speculative fan-out](https://docs.typesafe.ai/patterns/fan-out.md).
- **Select instead of generate.** Find candidate values or source spans in code,
  use a judgment to select the intended one, then copy or normalize it. Code can
  also assemble source text into a formatted document or reading guide. Explore
  [value extraction](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/pre_parsed_value_extraction_cookbook.md)
  and [structure recovery](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/autoformat.md).
- **Find and judge evidence.** Retrieve candidates, compare their relevance to a
  query, and select useful context. Explore [reranking](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/rerank_typesafe.md)
  and [hierarchical classification](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/hierarchical_classification.md).
- **Turn judgments into reusable data.** Score dimensions once, then let code or
  user controls change weights, thresholds, rankings, and views. With labeled
  outcomes, those signals can become classical ML features. Explore
  [composite scoring](https://docs.typesafe.ai/patterns/composite-scoring.md) and
  [feature discovery](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/autoresearch_feature_discovery.md).
- **Verify and escalate.** Check specific claims or fields against their evidence;
  send uncertain or failing cases to a person or reasoning model. Explore
  [citation checks](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/citation_check.md) and
  [extraction cascades](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/sde_cascade.md).
- **Respond to changing state.** Code can retain goals and observations while fresh
  judgments guide the next bounded step. Keep inferred state distinct from observed
  facts, and check freshness before applying a result to a changed situation.

For open-ended requests, offer the few directions that best serve the user's goal
and recommend a starting point. For a concrete request, choose the relevant pattern
and build; a brainstorm is not a mandatory detour.
